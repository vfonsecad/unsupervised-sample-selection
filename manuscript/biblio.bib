abstract = {Several applications, such as risk assessment within REACH or drug discovery, require reliable methods for the design of experiments and efficient testing strategies. Keeping the number of experiments as low as possible is important from both a financial and an ethical point of view, as exhaustive testing of compounds requires significant financial resources and animal lives. With a large initial set of compounds, experimental design techniques can be used to select a representative subset for testing. Once measured, these compounds can be used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict properties of the remaining compounds. This reduces the required resources and time. D-Optimal design is frequently used to select an optimal set of compounds by analyzing data variance. We developed a new sequential approach to apply a D-Optimal design to latent variables derived from a partial least squares (PLS) model instead of principal components. The stepwise procedure selects a new set of molecules to be measured after each previous measurement cycle. We show that application of the D-Optimal selection generates models with a significantly improved performance on four different data sets with end points relevant for REACH. Compared to those derived from principal components, PLS models derived from the selection on latent variables had a lower root-mean-square error and a higher Q2 and R2. This improvement is statistically significant, especially for the small number of compounds selected.},

abstract = {The composition of produced milk has great value for the dairy farmer. It determines the economic value of the milk and provides valuable information about the metabolism of the corresponding cow. Therefore, online measurement of milk components during milking 2 or more times per day would provide knowledge about the current health and nutritional status of each cow individually. This information provides a solid basis for optimizing cow management. The potential of visible and near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy for predicting the fat, crude protein, lactose, and urea content of raw milk online during milking was, therefore, investigated in this study. Two measurement modes (reflectance and transmittance) and different wavelength ranges for Vis/NIR spectroscopy were evaluated and their ability to measure the milk composition online was compared. The Vis/NIR reflectance measurements allowed for very accurate monitoring of the fat and crude protein content in raw milk (R(2){\textgreater}0.95), but resulted in poor lactose predictions (R(2){\textless}0.75). In contrast, Vis/NIR transmittance spectra of the milk samples gave accurate fat and crude protein predictions (R(2){\textgreater}0.90) and useful lactose predictions (R(2)=0.88). Neither Vis/NIR reflectance nor transmittance spectroscopy lead to an acceptable prediction of the milk urea content. Transmittance spectroscopy can thus be used to predict the 3 major milk components, but with lower accuracy for fat and crude protein than the reflectance mode. Moreover, the small sample thickness (1mm) required for NIR transmittance measurement considerably complicates its online use.},

abstract = {The effect of cultivar, season, shelf-life and origin on the accuracy of near infrared (NIR) calibration models for the soluble solids content (SSC) and firmness of apple was studied based on a large spectral data set based on approximately 6000 apple fruit from different cultivars, origins, shelf-life exposure time and seasons. To interpret the variance in the spectra with respect to biological variability, functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) was used. From the FANOVA analysis it was concluded that the effects of cultivar, origin and shelf-life exposure time on the NIR spectra were all significant. The largest differences in the spectra were found around the water absorption peaks (970, 1170 and 1450 nm). External validations using independent data sets showed that the accuracy of the models increased considerably when more variability was included in the calibration data set. In general the RMSEP for predictions of the SSC were in the range 0.6-0.8 °Brix, while for Magness Taylor firmness it was 5.9-8.8 N, depending on the cultivar. It was shown that atypical data can lead to large validation errors. It is, therefore, important to collect a calibration data set which is sufficiently representative for future samples to be analyzed with the developed calibration models and to develop simple procedures for model adaptation during practical use. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The sensor was calibrated using the one-out cross-validation technique on a set of pig manure samples collected in the spring of 2004 and validated for its 'true' prediction accuracy on a set of samples collected in the spring of 2003 from different Flemish farms. Based on the values of coefficient of determination r2 and the ratio of standard deviation of validation set to root mean square error of cross-validation, the prediction results were evaluated as excellent for dry matter content, good for organic matter content and total nitrogen and approximate for ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium. The calibrations for potassium and calcium were only able to discriminate between high and low values. These are encouraging results to recommend the VIS-NIR spectroscopy instrument for onsite measurement of manure composition.

abstract = {On-farm monitoring of milk composition can support close control of the udder and metabolic health of individual dairy cows. In previous studies, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy applied to milk analysis has proven useful for predicting the main components of raw milk (fat, protein, and lactose). In this contribution, we present and evaluate a precise tool for online milk composition analysis on the farm. For each milking, the online analyzer automatically collects and analyses a representative milk sample. The system acquires the NIR transmission spectra of the milk samples in the wavelength range from 960 to 1690 nm and performs a milk composition prediction afterward. Over a testing period of 8 weeks, the sensor collected 1165 NIR transmittance spectra of raw milk samples originating from 36 cows for which reference values were obtained for fat, protein, and lactose. For the same online sensor system, two calibration scenarios were evaluated: training post-hoc prediction models based on a representative set of calibration samples (n = 319) acquired over the entire testing period, with different cows in the calibration and test set, and training real-time prediction models exclusively on the samples acquired in the first week of the testing period (n = 308). The obtained prediction models were thoroughly tested on all the remaining samples not included in the calibration sets (n respectively 846 and 857). For the post-hoc prediction models, this resulted in an overall prediction error (root-mean-squared error of prediction, RMSEP) smaller than 0.080{\%} (all {\%} are in wt/wt) for milk fat (range 1.5–6.3{\%}), protein (2.6–4.3{\%}) and lactose (4–5.1{\%}), with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.989, 0.947 and 0.689 for fat, protein, and lactose respectively. For the real-time prediction models, the RMSEP was smaller than 0.092{\%} for milk fat and lactose, and 0.110{\%} for protein, with an R2 of 0.989 (fat), 0.894 (protein) and 0.644 (lactose). The milk lactose predictions could be further improved (RMSEP = 0.088{\%}, R2 = 0.675) by taking into account a cow-specific bias. The presented online sensor system using the real-time prediction approach can thus be used for detailed and autonomous on-farm monitoring of milk composition after each individual milking, as its accuracy is well within the requirements by the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) for on-farm milk analyzers and even meet the standards for laboratory analysis systems for fat and lactose. For this real-time prediction approach, a drift was observed in the predictions, especially for protein. Therefore, further research on the development of online calibration maintenance techniques is required to correct for this model drift and further improve the performance of this sensor system.},

The existing typical sample-selection algorithm is used for comparison. A set of soy sauce data is used as a set of typical samples that have a complex solution. Comparing the prediction results, it is shown that YR sample-selection has similar prediction performance to that of sample set partitioning based on joint x-y distances (SPXY), but with a simpler algorithm. The calibration models of the y-reference-included sample sets (SPXY and YR) are more accurate than those of y-reference-excluded sample sets (RS and KS).

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy is widely used to rapidly and cost-effectively collect chemical information from plant samples. Large datasets with hundreds to thousands of spectra and reference values are increasingly becoming more common as researchers accumulate data over many years or across research groups. These datasets potentially contain great spectral and chemical variation and could produce a broadly-applicable calibration model. In this study, partial least squares regression was used to model relationships between near infrared spectra and the foliar concentration of two ecologically-important chemical traits, available nitrogen and total formylated phloroglucinol compounds in Eucalyptus leaves. The nested spatial structure within the extensive dataset of spectra and reference values from 80 species of Eucalyptus was taken into account during calibration development and model validation. Geographic variation amongst samples influenced how well available nitrogen could be predicted. Predictive error of the model was greatest when tested against samples from different Australian states and local government areas to the calibration set. In addition, the results showed that simply relying on spectral variation (assessed by Mahalanobis distance) may mislead researchers into how many reference values are needed. The prediction accuracy of the model of available nitrogen differed little whether 300 or up to 987 calibration samples were included, which indicated that an excessive number of reference values were obtained. Lastly, a suitable multi-species calibration for formylated phloroglucinol compounds was produced and the difficulties associated with predicting complex chemical traits were discussed. Directing effort towards broadly applicable models will encourage sharing of calibration models across projects and research groups and facilitate the integration of near infrared spectroscopy in many research fields.},

Both linear and non-linear calibration methods are discussed for quantitative (continuous) and qualitative (discrete) quality traits. For each of the presented methods the theory is explained, followed by illustration of an example case from the postharvest domain and a discussion of applications of this technique for postharvest quality evaluation based on spectral sensors. As spectral preprocessing, careful validation and calibration transfer are crucial aspects for successful implementation of spectral sensors for postharvest quality evaluation, special attention is given to these aspects. Finally, conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made with respect to the steps to take and points of attention for successful calibration.},

abstract = {The selection of samples for modelling of visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectra for prediction of soil organic carbon (OC) is a crucial step for improving model prediction performance. This paper aims at comparing three soil sample selection methods coupled with spiking technique for improving on-line prediction performance of OC. Sample selection methods included random selection (RS), Kennard-Stone (KS) algorithm and similarity analysis (SA). Soil vis-NIR spectra was measured with an on-line fibre-type vis-NIR spectrophotometer (tec5 Technology for Spectroscopy, Germany), with a spectral range of 305–2200 nm. A multiple field sample set (268 samples) was merged with samples (148 samples) collected from one target field, and the resulted sample set was subjected to the three sample selection methods. After dividing spectra into calibration and prediction sets, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was run on the calibration set to develop calibration models for OC, and resulted models were validated using samples of the prediction set. Results show that SA performed generally better than its competitors, especially when there were 58 spiked samples used in the calibration set (54{\%} of total spiked samples of 106), with the best residual prediction deviation (RPD) and root mean squares error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.14–2.54 and 0.16–0.15{\%} for laboratory and on-line prediction. KS and RS performed similarly, but depending on the size of the calibration set, KS produced slightly better models. This indicates that the proposed SA coupled with spiking holds great potential in the optimization of a calibration set size and may serve as a novel and efficient tool for balancing the cost and quality of vis–NIR calibrations for estimating OC.},

Considering the static structure of the modeling dataset, the performance of the established NIR model could be degraded in the online process. To cope with this issue, an active training sample selection and updating strategy is proposed in this work. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it can select suitable modeling samples automatically according to the process information. Moreover, it can adjust model coefficients in a timely manner and avoid arbitrary updating effectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by applying the method to an industrial gasoline blending process.},

abstract = {The effect of using representative calibration sets with fewer samples was explored and discussed. The data set consisted of near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectra of grass samples. The grass samples were taken from different years covering a wide range of species and cultivars. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), a chemometric method, has been applied on NIR spectroscopy data for the determination of the nitrogen (N) concentration in these grass samples. The sample selection method based on NIR spectral data proposed by Puchwein and the CADEX (computer aided design of experiments) algorithm were used and compared. Both Puchwein and CADEX methods provide a calibration set equally distributed in space, and both methods require a minimum prior of knowledge. The samples were also selected randomly using complete random, cultivar random (year fixed), year random (cultivar fixed) and interaction (cultivar × year fixed) random procedures to see the influence of different factors on sample selection. Puchwein's method performed best with lowest RMSEP followed by CADEX, interaction random, year random, cultivar random and complete random. Out of 118 samples of the complete calibration set, 19 samples were selected as minimal number of representative samples. RMSEP values obtained for subsets selected using Puchwein, CADEX and using full calibration set were 0.099{\%} N, 0.109{\%} N and 0.092{\%} N respectively. The result indicated that the selection of representative calibration samples can effectively enhance the cost-effectiveness of NIR spectral analysis by reducing the number of analyzed samples in the calibration set by more than 80{\%}, which substantially reduces the effort of laboratory analyses with no significant loss in prediction accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In constructing models for predicting soil organic matter (SOM) by using visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy, the selection of representative calibration samples is decisive. Few researchers have studied the inclusion of spectral pretreatments in the sample selection strategy. We collected 108 soil samples and applied six commonly used spectral pretreatments to preprocess soil spectra, namely, Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing, first derivative (FD), logarithmic function log(1/R), mean centering (MC), standard normal variate (SNV), and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC). Then, the Kennard-Stone (KS) strategy was used to select calibration samples based on the pretreated spectra, and the size of the calibration set varied from 10 samples to 86 samples (80{\%} of the total samples). These calibration sets were employed to construct partial least squares regression models (PLSR) to predict SOM, and the built models were validated by a set of 21 samples (20{\%} of the total samples). The results showed that 64-78{\%} of the calibration sets selected by the inclusion of pretreatment demonstrated significantly better performance of SOM estimation. The average improved residual predictive deviations (DRPD) were 0.06, 0.13, 0.19, and 0.13 for FD, log(1/R), MSC, and SNV, respectively. Thus, we concluded that spectral pretreatment improves the sample selection strategy, and the degree of its influence varies with the size of the calibration set and the type of pretreatment.},

The potential of the selection algorithm to obtain calibrations for protein, moisture, and oil was tested with corn and rapeseed samples.

There are two adjustable 'parameters' controlling the procedure: 'alpha', in the continuum [0, 1], and 'omega', the number of regressors finally accepted.

As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis.

In order to gain a realistic and exhaustive overview over each individual's performance in different areas a large number of statistical results or plots need to be considered. Such a process often can be time consuming, cumbersome and may lead to biased conclusions. The proposed performance indices framework aims to act as an effective and practical complementary screening tool for panel leaders to help them quickly detect off-performances by assessors. The framework provides performance indices in the three following areas: agreement, repeatability and discrimination. Performance indices for agreement and repeatability are based on computations of either RV or RV2 coefficients, while the discrimination index is based on results from one- and two-way ANOVA. The performance indices can be easily presented in tables or graphs. Results show that they effectively detect underperforming assessors, and in combination with influence plots, provide a useful first overall impression in a rapid manner. Detailed performance issues can then be studied further in more detail with established statistical methods for performance evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A novel algorithm for partial least squares (PLS) regression, SIMPLS, is proposed which calculates the PLS factors directly as linear combinations of the original variables. The PLS factors are determined such as to maximize a covariance criterion, while obeying certain orthogonality and normalization restrictions. This approach follows that of other traditional multivariate methods. The construction of deflated data matrices as in the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)-PLS algorithm is avoided. For univariate y SIMPLS is equivalent to PLS1 and closely related to existing bidiagonalization algorithms. This follows from an analysis of PLS1 regression in terms of Krylov sequences. For multivariate Y there is a slight difference between the SIMPLS approach and NIPALS-PLS2. In practice the SIMPLS algorithm appears to be fast and easy to interpret as it does not involve a breakdown of the data sets. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

The method uses only the instrumental responses of a large set of samples to select the optimal subset, which is then submitted to chemical analysis and calibration. The subset is selected to provide a low variance of the regression coefficients. The methodology has been applied to UV- visible spectroscopy data to determine Ca2+ in water and near-IR spectroscopy data to determine moisture in com. In both cases, the regression models developed with a reduced number of samples provided accurate results. As far as precision is concerned, a similar root-mean-squared error of cross-validation (RMSECV) is found when comparing the new methodology with the results of the regression models that use the complete set of calibration samples and PCR. The number of analyzed samples in the calibration set can be reduced by up to 50{\%}, which represents a considerable reduction in costs.},

In addition, we present a new manifold-based active learning algorithm for Gaussian process classification. This new method uses a data-dependent kernel derived from a semi-supervised model that considers both labeled and unlabeled data. The method performs a regularization on the smoothness of the fitted function with respect to both the ambient space and the manifold where the data lie. The regularization parameter is treated as an additional kernel (covariance) parameter and estimated from the data, permitting adaptation of the kernel to the given dataset manifold geometry. Comparisons with other AL methods for manifold data show faster learning performance in our empirical experiments. MATLAB code that reproduces all examples is provided as supplementary materials.},
